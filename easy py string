#Hi guys.
#This is my first shortcut that i have learned it recently


name = "esi"
lastname = "alamdaari"
age = 20

#normal way to stick this 3 words to each other

print("my name is: "+name+" and my lastname is: "+lastname+" and my age is: "+age)
###this code doesn't works in python(beacuse of (23) that is int and you can't add string to integers)


#new way(easy string)
#it is only works for python

print(f'my name is: {name} and my lastname is: {lastname} and my age is: {age}')
